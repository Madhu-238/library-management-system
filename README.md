  Step 1: Download MySQL Installer
Go to the official website:
ðŸ‘‰ https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Click on Download under MySQL Workbench.

You might be asked to login/signup â€” you can skip by clicking "No thanks, just start my download."

After download, open the .msi installer file.

Follow the setup wizard:

Accept License Agreement

Choose Typical setup (recommended for most users).

Click Next and then Install.

Choose a version (8.0 recommended)

Set a root password during installation (IMPORTANT â€” remember it!)

Step 4: Open and Connect
Open MySQL Workbench.

Click on the Local instance MySQL80 (or whatever connection shows).

Enter the root password you set during MySQL Server installation.
